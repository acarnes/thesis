In 2012 two collaborations at the Large Hadron Collider announced the discovery of a new boson at 125 GeV with properties similar to the Standard Model Higgs. In order to determine whether the boson is actually the Standard Model Higgs, all of the different decay modes need to be investigated. Insofar, any deviations from the Standard Model in one of these channels would imply new physics. 

This dissertation presents the search for the Standard Model Higgs Boson decaying to $\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$. The search uses the $35.9\pm0.9$~fb$^{-1}$ of $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV proton-proton collision data recorded by the CMS detector in 2016. The observed and expected upper limits on the rate at a 95 \% confidence level are presented for Higgs masses in the range 120 to 130 GeV. The expected and observed upper limits at a mass of 125 GeV are x.xx and $1.98^{+0.81}_{-0.57}$ $\times$ SM respectively. These results provide the best results to date on the Higgs coupling to second generation fermions. No deviations from the Standard Model are observed.
