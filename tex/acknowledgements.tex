I would like to thank my Mom and Dad for just being all around great parents. Without all of their support, the completion of this Ph.D would never have been possible. I would also like to thank Professors Paul Avery and Darin Acosta for their help. In addition, I would like to thank Andrew Brinkerhoff, Pierluigi Bortignon, and Andrea Marini for all of their support and hard work on the project. I'd also like to thank my friends Stany, Leo, Sean, Sophie, and David for making Geneva a great place to live.}
