\chapter{RESULTS FOR THE $H\rightarrow\mu^+\mu^-$ SEARCH} \label{results}

With the categories finalized, the signal and background models pinned down, and the systematic uncertainties set, the results are calculated. The upper limit on the signal strength, the background only p-value, and the best fit of the signal strength are calculated for the 13 TeV data. These results are then combined with the 2012 results from 7 and 8 TeV data. The limits presented use the CLs method.  
\section{Results For 13 TeV Data}
Figures \ref{fig:limitPerCat} to \ref{fig:signalstrength13} present the upper limits, background only p-value, and the best fit signal strength for 13 TeV data. For $m_H$ = 125 GeV, the observed upper limit on the signal strength at 95\% confidence is 2.98, while the expected (median) upper limit if the background only hypothesis is true is 2.44. For $m_H$ = 125 GeV, the observed p-value on the background only hypothesis is 0.62$\sigma$, while the expected p-value on the background only if $H\rightarrow\mu^+\mu^-$ obeys the SM is 0.85$\sigma$. The best fit signal strength at $m_H$ = 125 GeV is $0.7^{+1.3}_{-1.1}$. A weighted average of the S+B fits in each category is shown in Figure \ref{fig:splusbweight}, and the individual fits per category are shown in Figures \ref{fig:fitsbycat1} and \ref{fig:fitsbycat1}.

\section{Results Combining 7, 8, And 13 TeV Data}
Figures \ref{fig:limit7813} to \ref{fig:signalstrength7813} present the upper limits, background only p-value, and the best fit signal strength for the combined 7, 8, and 13 TeV data. For $m_H$ = 125 GeV, the observed upper limit at 95\% confidence is 2.93, while the expected (median) upper limit is 2.16 if the background only hypothesis is true. For $m_H$ = 125 GeV, the observed p-value on the background only hypothesis is 0.91$\sigma$, and the expected p-value if the Higgs is SM is 0.96$\sigma$. The best fit signal strength at $m_H$ = 125 GeV is $0.9^{+1.0}_{-0.9}$.
